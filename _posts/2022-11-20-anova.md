|------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Person     | ID (1-20) for each participant                  | factor   |
| Treatment  | ID (1-6) for each cereal and milk combination   | factor   |
| Cereal     | ON: name-brand, OFF: off-brand                  | factor   |
| Milk       | Milk type: 2%, Almond, Soy                      | factor   |
| Rank       | Tastiness score (1-10): 1 = Bad, 10 = Perfect   | numeric  |


| Treatment Number   | Combination                         |

| 6                  | off-brand cereal and soy milk       |

### Research Questions
1) Is there a difference in tastiness scores between brand name Frosted Flakes (Kellogs) and off brand Frosted Flakes (Malt-O-Meal)?

2) Is there a difference in tastiness scores between different types of milk? (2%, almond, soy)

### Two-way ANOVA
A two-way ANOVA is a method used to compare averages between groups when you are looking at two factors that could affect the outcome. In this experiment, we want to see how **cereal type** (brand name vs off-brand) and **milk type** (2%, almond, soy) impact the tastiness score of the cereal. A two-way ANOVA helps us answer these questions:

1) Does cereal type impact tastiness scores?

2) Does milk type impact tastiness scores?

3) Does a combination of cereal type and milk type impact tastiness scores?

**Cereal Type:**

Null Hypothesis: The mean tastiness scores are the same for name-brand and off-brand cereal.

H<sub>0</sub>: &mu;<sub>name-brand</sub> = &mu;<sub>off-brand</sub>

Alternate Hypothesis: The mean tastiness scores are different for name-brand and off-brand cereal.

H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;<sub>name-brand</sub> &ne; &mu;<sub>off-brand</sub>

**Milk Type:**

Null Hypothesis: The mean tastiness scores are the same for all milk types (2%, almond, soy).

H<sub>0</sub>: &mu;<sub>2%</sub> = &mu;<sub>almond</sub> = &mu;<sub>soy</sub>

Alternate Hypothesis: At least one milk type has a different mean tastiness score.

H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;<sub>2%</sub> &ne; &mu;<sub>almond</sub> &ne; &mu;<sub>soy</sub>

### Assumptions
**1. Independence of observations:** Each data point is independent of each other because the tastiness score for one person's cereal and milk combination does not influence the tastiness score for another person's cereal and milk combination.

**2. Normality:** A histogram of the residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted tastiness scores) is approximately normally distributed.

**3. Equal Variance:** The distribution of tastiness scores for cereal (name-brand vs. off brand) and milk (2%, almond, soy) show a similar spread, indicating equal variance across groups.
