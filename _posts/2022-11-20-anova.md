### Introduction
Is name-brand cereal worth the extra cost, or does it depend more on the milk you pour over it? Do people like the taste of name-brand cereal more than off-brand cereal? Using a dataset of taste test scores, we will explore these questions with a two-way ANOVA. By the end, you will learn how to apply this method to answer real-world questions and see which cereal-milk combo is the best. Let's begin!

### What is a Two-way ANOVA?
A two-way ANOVA is a method used to compare the means of different groups based on two factors (categorical variables) that could affect the outcome. In general, a two-way ANOVA allows us to answer these questions:

1) Does the first factor influence the outcome?

2) Does the second factor influence the outcome?

3) Does the interaction between the two factors influence the outcome?

### Overview
Now that we've covered the basics of a two-way ANOVA and when to use it, let's look at a real-world example. Below, you will find details about the dataset and a step-by-step guide on how to perform a two-way ANOVA using R.

### Dataset
Data was collected by having participants rate six different cereal and milk combinations. Each combination was presented in a separate cup. Participants were not aware of the specific brand of cereal or milk type in each cup to prevent bias. They rated each combination on a scale from 1 (dislike) to 10 (like). The dataset is called "cereal.csv" and can be accessed [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ovLiyNvYR_E--q8c-FJdXn-2tV2IP6Qx9WoK4oZFjBk/edit?usp=sharing)

| Variable   | Information                                     | Type     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Person     | ID (1-20) for each participant                  | factor   |

| Treatment Number   | Combination                         |                                                                              
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1                  | name-brand cereal and 2% milk       |                           
| 2                  | off-brand cereal and 2% milk        |
| 3                  | name-brand cereal and almond milk   |                                   
| 4                  | off-brand cereal and almond milk    |                                                                 
| 5                  | name-brand cereal and soy milk      |
| 6                  | off-brand cereal and soy milk       |

### Research Questions
In this experiment, we want to see how **cereal type** (brand name vs off-brand) and **milk type** (2%, almond, soy) affect the tastiness score of the cereal. Our research questions are:

1) Is there a difference in tastiness scores between brand name Frosted Flakes (Kellogs) and off brand Frosted Flakes (Malt-O-Meal)?

2) Is there a difference in tastiness scores between different types of milk? (2%, almond, soy)

3) Does the interaction between cereal type and milk type affect tastiness scores?

### Hypotheses
Let's define null and alternate hypotheses for each factor:

**Cereal Type:**

Null Hypothesis: The mean tastiness scores are the same for name-brand and off-brand cereal.

H<sub>0</sub>: &mu;<sub>name-brand</sub> = &mu;<sub>off-brand</sub>

Alternate Hypothesis: The mean tastiness scores are different for name-brand and off-brand cereal.

H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;<sub>name-brand</sub> &ne; &mu;<sub>off-brand</sub>

**Milk Type:**

Null Hypothesis: The mean tastiness scores are the same for all milk types (2%, almond, soy).

H<sub>0</sub>: &mu;<sub>2%</sub> = &mu;<sub>almond</sub> = &mu;<sub>soy</sub>

Alternate Hypothesis: At least one milk type has a different mean tastiness score.

H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;<sub>2%</sub> &ne; &mu;<sub>almond</sub> &ne; &mu;<sub>soy</sub>

### R Code

**Step 1: Import the Dataset**
{%- highlight r -%}
# read in the dataset
data <- read.csv("cereal.csv", header = TRUE)

# convert columns to factors or numeric variables
milk <- as.factor(data$Milk)
cereal <- as.factor(data$Cereal)
person <- as.factor(data$Person)
taste <- data$Rank
{%- endhighlight -%}

**Step 2: Fit the Linear Model:**
{%- highlight r -%}
fit <- lm(taste~person+milk*cereal)
{%- endhighlight -%}

**Step 3: Perform the Two-Way ANOVA**
{%- highlight r -%}
anova(fit)
{%- endhighlight -%}

Here is the Analysis of Variance table:


|             | Df | Sum Sq  | Mean Sq | F value | Pr(>F)        |
|-------------|----|---------|---------|---------|---------------|
| person      | 19 | 92.55   | 4.871   | 1.1904  | 0.2822        |
| milk        | 2  | 85.14   | 42.569  | 10.4033 | 8.214e-05 *** |
| cereal      | 1  | 3.67    | 3.675   | 0.8901  | 0.3457        |
| milk:cereal | 2  | 4.21    | 2.106   | 0.5147  | 0.5993        |
| Residuals   | 95 | 388.73  | 4.092   |         |               |


I will explain how to interpret the output in Step 5.

**Step 4: Checking the Assumptions**
For a valid two-way ANOVA, we much check the following assumptions:

**1. Independence of observations:** Each data point is independent of each other because the tastiness score for one person's cereal and milk combination does not influence the tastiness score for another person's cereal and milk combination.

**2. Normality:** A histogram of the residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted tastiness scores) is approximately normally distributed.

![Figure]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/qqplot.png)

**3. Equal Variance:** The distribution of tastiness scores for cereal (name-brand vs. off brand) and milk (2%, almond, soy) show a similar spread, indicating equal variance across groups.

![Figure]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cereal.png)

![Figure]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/milk.png)

Here is the code to check assumptions:
{%- highlight r -%}
# Normality of Residuals
hist(fit$residuals, main = "Histogram of the Residuals")
qqnorm(fit$residuals)
qqline(fit$residuals, col = "red")

# Equal Variance
boxplot(taste~milk)
boxplot(taste~cereal)
{%- endhighlight -%}

**Step 5: Interpret the Results**
Again, here is the Analysis of Variance table:


|             | Df | Sum Sq  | Mean Sq | F value | Pr(>F)        |
|-------------|----|---------|---------|---------|---------------|
| person      | 19 | 92.55   | 4.871   | 1.1904  | 0.2822        |
| milk        | 2  | 85.14   | 42.569  | 10.4033 | 8.214e-05 *** |
| cereal      | 1  | 3.67    | 3.675   | 0.8901  | 0.3457        |
| milk:cereal | 2  | 4.21    | 2.106   | 0.5147  | 0.5993        |
| Residuals   | 95 | 388.73  | 4.092   |         |               |


Main Effects: Look at the p-values for the cereal type and milk type. If either of them are less than the significant level (usually 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis for that factor. 

Interaction Effect: Look at the p-value for the interaction between milk and cereal. If is it less than the significant level (usually 0.05), it suggests that the effect of one factor depends on the level of the other factor.

**Answers to our Research Questions:**

1) Is there a difference in tastiness scores between brand name Frosted Flakes (Kellogs) and off brand Frosted Flakes (Malt-O-Meal)?

**No:** The p-value for cereal type is greater than 0.05, indicating that cereal type does not have a significant effect on tastiness scores.

2) Is there a difference in tastiness scores between different types of milk? (2%, almond, soy)

**Yes:** The p-value for milk type is less than 0.05, indicating that milk type has a significant impact on tastiness scores.

3) Does the interaction between cereal type and milk type affect tastiness scores?

**No:** The p-value for the interaction between cereal type and milk type is greater than 0.05, indicating that their combined effect is not significant.

**Which Milk Type is the Best?**
{%- highlight r -%}
# Calculate mean tastiness scores for each combination of milk and cereal
tapply(taste, list(milk, cereal), mean)
{%- endhighlight -%}


| milk     | off-brand | name-brand |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2%       | 6.050     | 6.025      |
| Almond   | 5.075     | 4.200      |
| Soy      | 4.100     | 3.950      |


Since milk type is the only significant factor, let's focus on how tastiness scores differ across 2%, almond, and soy milk, regardless of the cereal type:

**2% milk** has the highest tastiness scores overall, with averages of 6.050 (off-brand) and 6.025 (name-brand).

### Conclusion
Our analysis reveals that milk type significantly impacts tastiness scores, with 2% milk outperforming almond milk and soy milk. Suprisingly, cereal type (name-brand vs. off-brand) had no significant effect on tastiness scores. So, the next time you're deciding between name-brand and off-brand cereal, focus on the type of milk you buy instead!

**Further Research:** To build upon these findings, future research could explore tastiness scores across different types of cereals. We can compare fruity vs. choclatey cereals. We can also test more milk options and narrow down our analysis to regular milks (whole milk, reduced-fat milk, skim milk, and fat-free milk) or just dairy free milks (almond milk, cashew milk, oatmilk, coconut milk). How do you think we could expand our analysis?
