### Introduction
Have you ever wondered by some movies dominate the box office? Well, different genres play a huge role in the popularity of a film. In this post, we will generate movie data using the [The Movie Database (TBDb) API.](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) By analyzing thousands of movies and their popularity scores, we can discover the most popular movie genres. I will also provide code that allows you to find the most popular films within each genre.

### Research Question
On average, which genres are most popular?

### How to Gather Data using an API
These steps will go over how to gather and clean data from [The Movie Database (TMDb) API.](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) If you want to follow along, here is a link to my GitHub repo with code for gathering the data: [gather_data.ipynb.](https://github.com/laurenscarzella/my-api/blob/main/gather_data.ipynb)

**1. Register for an API Key:**
Create or sign into your TMDb account [here.](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup) Register for an API key by following the directions on the "Getting Started" webpage found [here.](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) Make sure to fill out all the required information accurately. You can find your API key by navigating to Settings/API. I stored my API key in a .gitignore file and extracted the key when needed in my code. 

**2. Choose an Endpoint:** Define the URL for the API. In this case, the "discover/movie" endpoint is used to get information such as movie titles, popularity scores, genres, and more from a list of movies. To authenticate the requests, the API key is read from a .gitignore file to keep the API key private.

{%- highlight python -%}
import requests
import pandas as pd
url = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie"
with open("tmdbapikey.txt", "r") as file:
    api_key = file.read().strip()
{%- endhighlight -%}

**2. Fetch and Store Data Locally:**
Initialize an empty list to store the data from all API responses and iterate over multiple pages to collect more data. Next, define the request parameters. I wanted a list of movies that filters for adult content, excludes videos, and specifies that the preferred language is English. Make the GET request while handling successful responses and errors. Lastly, convert the collected list to a pandas DataFrame and save it to a CSV.

{%- highlight python -%}
all = []
for page in range(1, 500):
    params = {
        'api_key': api_key,
        'include_adult': 'true',
        'include_video': 'false',
        'language': 'en-US',
        'page': page,
        'sort_by': "popularity.desc"
    }
    r = requests.get(url, params = params)
    if r.status_code == 200:
        data = r.json()
        all.extend(data.get("results", []))
    else:
        print(f"Failed to fetch data for page {page}: {r.status_code}")
        break
df = pd.DataFrame(all)
df.to_csv("movie_data.csv", index = False)
{%- endhighlight -%}

**3. Clean the Data:**
Read in the messy dataset and filter for relevant columns such as title, popularity, genre_ids, etc. Convert the genre IDs into genre names by making a separate API request using the "genre/movie/list" endpoint and mapping each ID to their corresponding name. If a movie has multiple genres, save the first genre as the primary genre. Drop any unnecessary columns and data with missing values. Save the cleaned data to a new CSV file.

{%- highlight python -%}
# read the saved movie data
filtered = pd.read_csv("movie_data.csv")
# select columns to keep
keep = ['title', 'adult', 'genre_ids', 'id', 'original_language', 'popularity', 'release_date', 'vote_count', 'vote_average']
filtered = filtered[keep]
# check if genre_ids is already a list and fix if necessary
def parse_genre_ids(x):
    if isinstance(x, str):
        try:
            return eval(x)
        except:
            return []
    elif isinstance(x, list):
        return x
    return []
# convert genre_ids from a string to list of integers
filtered['genre_ids'] = filtered['genre_ids'].apply(parse_genre_ids)
# select url for fetching genre names
base_url_genres = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/genre/movie/list"
# fetch the genre data
params_genres = {
    "api_key": api_key,
    "language": "en-US"
}
genre_response = requests.get(base_url_genres, params=params_genres)
# check if the genre request was successful
if genre_response.status_code == 200:
    genres_data = genre_response.json()
    genre_mapping = {genre['id']: genre['name'] for genre in genres_data['genres']}
else:
    print(f"Failed to fetch genre data: {genre_response.status_code}")
# convert genre_ids to genre_names
filtered['genre_names'] = filtered['genre_ids'].apply(lambda ids: [genre_mapping.get(genre_id) for genre_id in ids])
# extract the primary genre (first genre in the list)
filtered['primary_genre'] = filtered['genre_names'].apply(lambda x: x[0] if x else None)
# remove genre_ids and genre_names columns before saving
filtered = filtered.drop(['genre_ids', 'genre_names'], axis=1)
# remove rows with any missing values
filtered_cleaned = filtered.dropna()
# Save the cleaned DataFrame to a CSV file
filtered_cleaned.to_csv("cleaned_movies.csv", index=False)
{%- endhighlight -%}

### What Are the Most Popular Movie Genres?
The top five genres by popularity are Science Fiction, Animation, Action, Horror, and Fantasy.

**What Are the Most Popular Movies in Each Genre?**
I wanted to focus on the most popular movie genre Science Fiction. However, you can choose from any other genre from the dropdown menu generated from [this code](https://github.com/laurenscarzella/my-api/blob/main/EDA.ipynb) in Python.

### Ethics
When gathering data from this API, I made sure to follow the API Terms of Use outlined [here.](https://www.themoviedb.org/api-terms-of-use) TMDb encourages the use of thier API for developers as long as they avoid overwhelming thier servers and staying under usage limits. I did this through pagination and limiting the requests made. I also made sure to keep my API key private by storing it in a .gitignore file. By following these practices, I collected data ethically and responsibly.

### Conclusion
As we can see, movie genres play a crucial role in box office numbers. But that is just the beginning! We can take it a step further and ask ourselves: Is there a significant difference in popularity between genres using statistical methods like one-way ANOVA? Or, we can dive deeper by analyzing which factors can effectively predict popularity? The only thing stopping you from finding valuable insights is your creativity!

What other questions should we explore? Are there different insights or data points we can extract from this API to enhance our analysis?
