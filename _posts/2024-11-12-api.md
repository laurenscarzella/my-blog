### Introduction

### Research Question
Which genres are most popular on average?

### How to Gather Data using an API
These steps will go over how to gather and clean data from [The Movie Database (TMDb) API.](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started)

Register for an API Key:
- Create or sign into your TMDb account [here.](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup)
- Register for an API key by following the directions on the "Getting Started" webpage found [here.](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) Make sure to fill out all the required information honestly.
- You can find your API key by navigating to Settings/API. It should show up as a gray text box that you can use for later.

Understand API Documentation:
- Review the documentation to understand all the different endpoints, available parameters, rate limits, and response formats.
- For this guide, I will be using is the "discover/movie" endpoint where each request outputs a list of movies with information such as movie ID, original language, overview, popularity, release date, title, vote average, vote count, and more.
- Make sure to check for pagination. In this example, more data can be returned across multiple pages. I collected data by iterating through pages 1 to 500, which is the maximum number of pages allowed.

Make API Requests:
Using the API key, send a GET request to the "discover/movie" endpoint with the required parameters.

Store the Data:
