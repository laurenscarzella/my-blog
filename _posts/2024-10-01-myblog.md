### Introduction

Have you ever felt like youâ€™re spending just as much money as you make? Well, you probably need a budget! Tracking your spending is crucial for finding and preventing unnecessary expenses, saving for big purchases, and understanding your financial habits. In this post, I will guide you through a step-by-step process of tracking your expenses in Excel and analyzing the data with R. By the end, you will have the tools and insights you need to take control of your finances and create a budget that works for you.

### 1. Track Your Spending Data in Excel

Start by tracking your spending for at least one month. Collecting this data is essential for creating a budget that reflects your spending habits. This process will not only help you set appropriate limits for each category but also optimize your savings. 

- **Use or Create a Spending Template:** You can find an existing template online or use the one that I created [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nRmzAKheHjwCHECwYgvZ-jERzIlEdcgLmrolszi9r6k/edit?usp=sharing) You will have to go to File > Make a Copy to create your own editable version of the spreadsheet. The page called "Column Information" describes each column of the dataset in more detail and how to enter each transaction.

- **Download as a CSV File:** Once you have recorded your spending, go to File > Download > Comma Separated Values (.csv) to save the data as a .csv file for manipulation in R later.

### 2. Load and Clean the Data in R

After you have collected your data, load it into R. For demonstration purposes, I will be using a sample dataset generated from the spending template I linked above. This dataset tracks spending for two months. You can see the dataset at the following link: [sample dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N8JQ8nMcRQux7SRm3fgfkLBKPJEKhRZ7ETop2XEZ2qo/edit?usp=sharing)

- **Load the Dataset:** Use the 'read.csv()' function to import the data into R.
- **Ensure Valid Variable Types:** Check that your data types are correct where amounts are numeric and categories are factors. You will also need to convert the "Date" column from a character type to a Date type and specify the original format of the data.
- **Remove Unwanted Characters:** You can use 'gsub()' to remove dollar signs from the "Amount" column and the "Money.Left" column and covert them to numeric variables.

### 3. Visualize the Data in R

Data visualizations are helpful to understand your spending habits better. Here are some visualizations to consider:

**Bar Chart:** Total amount of money spent in each category. This helps you identify which categories consume most of your budget, allowing you to make more informed decisions on where to cut back spending.

**Pie Chart:** Display the emotion felt during each transaction. Tracking your emotions can help you underdstand if there are any emotional triggers behind your spending and reduce impulsive or stress-reduced spending.

**Line Chart:** Illustrate the total amount of money left in your account over time. This gives you a visual representation of how your account balance changes over time which can help you detect overpsending/large purchases and plan your budget accordingly.

**Dot Map:** Create a map showing where each transaction took place. If you record the location (latitude, longitude) of each transaction, you can see the stores you tend to shop at and if there are any stores with an unusual amount of unnecessary transactions. 

Here is a link to view the interactive map.

{%- highlight r -%}
map_summary <- mapdf %>%
  group_by(Latitude, Longitude, `Store.Name`) %>% # each unique combination of these three variables are treated as a separate group
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = 'drop') # counts the number of transactions for each group n() and creates a new data frame called map_summary
 
leaflet(data = map_summary) %>% # creates map using map_summary data
  addTiles() %>% # adds default map tiles from OpenStreetMap to leaflet map
  addMarkers( # adds marker for each location by latitude and longitude
    ~Longitude, ~Latitude,
    popup = ~paste("Location:", `Store.Name`, "<br>", # specify what will be displayed in the popup
                   "Count of Transactions:", Count)
  ) %>%
  setView(lng = mean(map_summary$Longitude, na.rm = TRUE), # sets the view to the average latitude and longitude values from the data
          lat = mean(map_summary$Latitude, na.rm = TRUE), 
          zoom = 12)
{%- endhighlight -%}

### 4. Find Total Amount of Money Spent in Each Category

{%- highlight r -%}
july_df <- head(df, 68)
sum <- aggregate(Amount ~ Category, data = july_df, FUN = base::sum)
print(sum)
{%- endhighlight -%}

### 5. Set Budget Totals For Each Category


### 6. Make Budget Templet in Excel
